<h3> Exploring Web Services API </h3>

<p>
    I performed the experiment on web services this week. I learned how to import data from a web service into the website.
    I also explored different available API's and their available methods. In experiment, I used the soundcloud API to allow
    users to search for music tracks based on keywords. Then, I display the top 5 results on the webpage in a table. I also explored the
    different API required for my project on music library. This experiment will be very useful in my project as well.
