<h3>Removed jCaraousel slider, introduced a flip image gallery</h3>
<p>
   I removed the jCaraousel slider as it was not rendering my data properly, and introduced a flip image gallery 
    in its place which looks more fancy.

    My whole website can be navigated through without a login. As Prof. Rasala suggested that everything that is required
    to run the website should be on the tips of the users. Hence, I prefer not to have user login.<br />
    I finished the project documentation and have uploaded everything on the server now.<br /><br />
    This is presumably my last blog post before the site is up for grading. CS 5610: Web Development course was the most 
    practice and learning oriented course I took in the Master's. I learned a lot of web technologies. Thanks you Prof. Rasala and Prof. 
    Annunziato for this wonderful course.<br /><br />
    I look forward to improving my website even after the course is finished in order to maintain a portfolio of
    my web development skills.
