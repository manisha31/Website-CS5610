<h3>Digging into JavaScript and jQuery</h3>

<p>
This week, I spent most of time learning more about JavaScript and jQuery. I also did an experiment using jQuery where I used its methods to
    show different effects on the html elements.
    <br />
    I am also learning to make an image content slider and will be putting it as an experiment soon.
