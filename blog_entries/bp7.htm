<h3> Project Approved and Exploring Bootstrap components</h3>

<p>
This week I presented my project proposal to my TA - Yitao and professor Rasala. Professor approved my project proposal and provided
    important feedback that will make me think about some important implementation related to the project. I plan to make a music library
    and it will have the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Allow users to search for a track based on keywords</li>
    <li> Allow users to search for artists and their information</li>
    <li> Display all the tracks sung by an artist</li>
    <li> Display most loved tracks</li>
    <li> Display similar tracks based on the user's listening data</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I have figured out the API that I am going to use for my project and it is "last.fm" API which provides me appropriate methods.
    It is a restful API and provides JSON response.<br />

    I also downloaded Bootstrap and explored its various components this week. I have conducted an experiment of the same, where I explore the
    responsive layout, navigational bars, and other components.
