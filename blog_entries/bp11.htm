<h3>Designed MASTER PAGE,added JQuery Slider, Added style to Project and Website Homepage</h3>
<p>
    This week, I redesigned my website homepgae making it more beautiful and responsive.
    I used the window tracker designed by Prof. Rasala to determine the size of window while making it responsive. 
    I have still kept it there, in case I need it in future.
    <br />
    I also added stylesheet to all my project pages making their navigation easy and appealing.
    I implemented a JQuery Slider in my Artist Details page to show the Similar Artists to users.
    <br />
    I also designed a master page for my project. It includes the header- navigational menu, logo, menu-icon of the project. It allows you to create a consistent layout for the pages in your application.
     A single master page defines the look and feel and standard behavior that you want for all of the pages (or a group of pages)
     in your application. You can then create individual content pages that contain the content you want to display. 
    When users request the content pages, they merge with the master page to produce output that combines the layout of the master
     page with the content from the content page.
