<h3> Album Search, Artist Search and Artist Info</h3>

<p>
This week, I worked on my project and implemented the functionalities of Album Search, Artist Search based on a keyword entered in 
    a textbox by the user. Then I parse the JSON response obtained from Lastfm.com API to display the results on my webpage in form of a a
    simple table presently. I also made the names of Artists on the ArtistSearch page clickable. So, on clicking the name of an 
    artist, it navigates to other page and displays the information of that artist.
    <br />
    I was working on displaying the "Album Information" after selecting a particular album on AlbumSearch, when the server of Lastfm got down.
    So if the server is down you will not be able to see the results, as we can not hit the API. Therefore, next week I will work
    on implementing the validations if no result is found or if server is down.
    <br />
    Also, right now I just implemented the functionality on simple pages to check if the API is showing proper responses as I want them. 
    Working on CSS and representation of data in fancy way is on my TO-DO list. That's it for this week!! :)
