<h3>Working on Experiments</h3>

<p>
  I used Javascript to implement the responsive behaviour in text. In Experiment 1 when there is a mouse over the 
    text, it changes its color. And again changes back to its original color on the mouse out. In experiment 2, I have an image which 
    can be resized to three different sizes available. Also, on mouse over upon a specific size, it is highlighted with a different color.
    <br />
    I look forward to learn more about HTML/CSS and Javascript and implement in my experiments.
