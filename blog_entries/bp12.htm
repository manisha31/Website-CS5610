<h3>Pages Implemented - Events and Contact Us, Experiment- RSS Feed, jCaraousel Slider on Home</h3>
<p>
    This week, I implemented a JCaraousel Slider on Home page pf project using a JQuery Plugin. Special credits to bxslider.
    I customised the slider according to my need. I also conducted an experiment on parsing RSS Feed by iTunes Store for 
    getting the top albums. I then display these top albums on my homepage inside the slider. Now, this was a tough deal and my slider is
    still showing some inconsistencies. I might change it altogether.
    <br />
    I also implemented an Events page. Users can search for various events that an artist is performing on. The Lastfm api method gives 
    a JSON response with details about the events, which I display inside the divs. <br />
    Last but not least, I also implemented the Contact Us page which includes a brief description about the website, my contact details
    and my location shown on the Google Maps. This page is responsive as well.
    <br />
    I look forward to improving my homepage and the slider. Hope you like my website. Thanks!!:)
