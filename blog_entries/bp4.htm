<h3>jQuery and ASP.net </h3>

<p>
    This week I thought about several ideas for the project like a car pooling website. But, I further need to finalize the topic
    and make a detailed view of the project. Also, I digged further in jQuery learning using which I created a tabbed content holder.
    This is a very useful content holder which can be used on a website. I am also working on creating login page validations and multilingual support 
    at the pages and will upload it once I am finished with it. I have started with some ASP.net hands on.
