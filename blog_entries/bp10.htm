<h3> XML Parsing Experiment and Project Functionality Implementation</h3>

<p>
This week I conducted an experiment on XML response parsing. I used the class XMLDocument to read the XML file. I find the root of the
    XML document and then use the method SelectSingleNode to grab the child nodes. I did this experiment because while I was trying to implement methods of my lastfm API, I
    saw that it gives XML response as well. 
    <br />
 In my project, I implemented the following functionalities in this week: 
    <br/>
    1. <b>Album Details Page </b>
    <br />
    - <b>Album Information:</b>
    We reach on this page after navigating from the Album Search page. Now, I use the method album.getinfo to display
    the information pertaining to the album that user wishes to see. I pass a parameter 'mbid' from the Album Search page into this page to form the
    url for the api method. I also use a function GetParameterValues that extracts the mbid from the URL. I also parse and display the different
    tracks in this album.
    <br />
    - <b>Buy Links for the Album:</b>
    I use the method album.getbuylinks of lastfm API to get the buy links for this album. It displays the various suppliers, price 
    and buy links where users can purchase this album from.
    <br />
    2. <b>Artist Details Page</b>
    <br />
    - <b>Similar Artists</b>
    <br />When the user reaches on the detail information page of an artist, I also display the artists which are similar to the
    artist which is selected and whose details are listed on the page. I use the method artist.getsimilar of lastfm API to display the
    similar artists images and names. The images of the artists are clickable. When you click on similar artist image, it opens that artist's
    details page.
    <br/>

    <b>Note:</b> A lot of work needs to be done on making the website look appealing using CSS. I also have to work on making it resonsive.
    Hope to get this part done in this week. Check out my site next week to see the updates. Thanks!! :)
