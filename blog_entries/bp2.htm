<h3>Redesigning home page</h3>

<p>
Last week I did an experiment using CSS. I divided my page into several sections using divs and spans. I adjusted the divs using margins and paddings.
    Later, I adapted the layout to my home page. I redesigned my home page and added different contents to the different sections. In the right divs, I added 
    widgets for analog clock, latest news feed and the weather report. I also added my contact information at the end by providing several fonts for facebook,
    mail and google+. I also customised my text fonts and colors, as well as added a background to make the page look colorful.<br />
    I will further add project and more stuff to the homepage as I learn and explore web technologies.
