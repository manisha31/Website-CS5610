<h3> Project Homepage</h3>

<p>
This week I worked on my project homepage. I designed a CSS for the homepage. I make use of a fancy font "Gondola_SD" which I have included in the fonts folder.
    I use @font-face in CSS to make use of this font. I am working on improving the homepage further and making it more responsive.
