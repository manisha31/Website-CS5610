    <h1> Layout for Home Page using CSS</h1>
    <h3> Description: </h3>
    <p>
In this experiment, I created an interesting layout to display my homepage. I used many div tags to divide the home page into sections.
        And using CSS, I designed the sections and placed them at appropriate relative positions in the page and set their margins and other properties.
